      <h3>No Experience Needed</h3>
      <p>Seriously. You don't need to know how to code or use a drill press. If you're curious about robotics and willing to learn, that's all it takes. We'll teach you the rest.</p>

      <h3>What You'll Get</h3>
      <p>Real hands-on experience with engineering, programming, and teamwork. A chance to compete in FTC tournaments. Friends who share your interests. And maybe some pizza during build season (no promises, but we try).</p>
