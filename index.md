  <h2 class="section-title">What We Do</h2>
  <p class="section-subtitle">We're a bunch of students who love building robots, breaking things (accidentally), and competing in FIRST Tech Challenge tournaments.</p>

      <h3 class="feature-title">Robot Design</h3>
      <p class="feature-description">We design and build FTC-legal robots, often with more ambition than time. But hey, that's half the fun!</p>

      <h3 class="feature-title">Programming</h3>
      <p class="feature-description">Our coders work on autonomous routines and driver controls using Java and the FTC SDK. Sometimes the robot even does what we want!</p>

      <h3>More Than Just Robots</h3>
      <p>FTC isn't just about building a winning robot (though we'd love that too). It's about learning real engineering skills, working as a team, and having fun along the way. We pull late nights before competitions, celebrate small victories, and learn from every setback.</p>

      <h3>Our Spirit</h3>
      <p>We might not have the biggest budget or the fanciest workshop, but we've got determination, creativity, and a lot of duct tape. Okay, we try not to use duct tape on the robot. But you get the idea.</p>
