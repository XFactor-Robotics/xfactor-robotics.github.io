  <h2 class="section-title">Our Story</h2>
  <p class="section-subtitle">We started small, and honestly, we're still figuring things out. But that's what makes it exciting.</p>

  <div class="about-content">
    <div class="about-text">
      <h3>How It Started</h3>
      <p>X_Factor Robotics began when a few of us discovered FIRST Tech Challenge and thought, "We could do that!" Turns out, it's harder than it looks. But we dove in anyway, learned from YouTube tutorials, asked a lot of questions, and slowly got the hang of it. We're still learning every day.</p>

      <h3>What Is FIRST Tech Challenge?</h3>
      <p>FTC is a robotics competition designed for students in grades 7-12. Each season brings a new game challenge, and teams have to design, build, and program a robot from scratch to compete. It's intense, it's stressful, and it's absolutely worth it. Plus, the FIRST community is incredibly supportive.</p>

      <h3>What Drives Us</h3>
      <p>We're here because we genuinely enjoy what we do. There's nothing quite like seeing your robot actually work (even if it took five redesigns to get there). We love the problem-solving, the teamwork, and yes, even the last-minute crunch before competitions.</p>

      <h3>Our Vibe</h3>
      <p>We take our robots seriously, but not ourselves. We're a mix of people with different skills and experience levels, all learning together. Some of us came in knowing a lot about engineering; others just thought robots were cool. Everyone belongs here.</p>
